        <h2>What is Internet? How does internet works?</h2>
        <p>The Internet (or internet) is the global system of interconnected computer networks that uses the Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP) to communicate between networks and devices. It is a network of networks that consists of private, public, academic, business, and government networks of local to global scope, linked by a broad array of electronic, wireless, and optical networking technologies. The Internet carries a vast range of information resources and services, such as the inter-linked hypertext documents and applications of the World Wide Web (WWW), electronic mail, telephony, and file sharing.</p>

        <h2>what packets are and how they are used to transfer data?</h2>
        <p>A data packet is a unit of data made into a single package that travels along a given network path. Data packets are used in Internet Protocol (IP) transmissions for data that navigates the Web, and in other kinds of networks.For example, every Web page that you receive comes as a series of packets, and every e-mail you send leaves as a series of packets. Networks that ship data around in small packets are called packet switched networks.</p>
        <h2>The differences between a web page, web server, web browser and search engine.</h2>
        <h3>Web Page</h3>
        <p>A document which can be displayed in a web browser such as  Google Chrome,  Microsoft Internet Explorer or Edge. These are also often called just "pages.</p>
        <h3>Web Server</h3>
        <p>A computer which stores a website or other data that can be accessed over the Internet or which provides other services to network. </p>
        <h3>Web Browser</h3>
        <p>A computer program with a graphical user interface for displaying HTML files used to navigate the World Wide Web.</p> 
        <h3>Search Engine</h3>
        <p>A program that search for andd identifies items in a database that correspond to keywords character specified by the user, used especially for finding particular site on the World wide Web. eg. google. </p>

        <h2>What is Internet Protocol</h2>
        <p>we've all sat down and sent out an email massage before but have you ever thought about how the massage gets from one to another.This is the job for internet protocol. Our language is very different from the language that a computer use so the massage that we create need to be translated from an alphabetic text into an electronic signal before they can be send this translation is handle in the computer by the separate modules in the communication protocol because these protocol or rule of conduct usually communicate with two or more modules they are best described as layers in a stack of protocol these layer are the application layer, transport layer, internet layer, link layer, physical layer. </p>
        <p>The massager that we sent our filter through these layer and broken down into a small chunks of data call packets we start with the application layer (eg. E-mail, massager) that you maybe familiar with  to create our massage one example of a protocol form which is Hypertext Transfer Protocol or HTTP.The transport layer uses the Transmissions Control Protocol or TCP to encapsulate the data block from the application layer it then move to the internet layer where the Internet Protocol or IP is used to deliver the packets these packets are delivered through the Link layer which is an Ethernet cable to the  Physical layer which id the basic hardware of your computer network.   </p>
